hexokinase
glycolysis
phosphorylates hexoses (six-carbon sugars), forming hexose phosphate.
2.7.1.1

phosphoglucose isomerase
glycolysis
interconverts glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P).
5.3.1.9

phosphofructokinase
glycolysis
phosphorylates fructose 6-phosphate.
2.7.1.11

aldolase
glycolysis
catalyzes a reversible reaction that splits the aldol, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, into the triose phosphates dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P).
4.1.2.13

Citrate synthase
citric acid cycle
catalyze the conversion of acetyl-CoA [H3CC(=O)−SCoA] and oxaloacetate [−O2CCH2C(=O)CO2−] into citrate [−O2CCH2C(OH)(CO2−)CH2CO2−] and H−SCoA in an aldol condensation reaction.
2.3.3.1

Aconitase
citric acid cycle
enzyme that catalyses the stereo-specific isomerization of citrate to isocitrate via cis-aconitate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, a non-redox-active process
4.2.1.3

citric acid cycle
catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, producing alpha-ketoglutarate (α-ketoglutarate) and CO2.
1.1.1.42

Fumarase
citric acid cycle
catalyzes the reversible hydration/dehydration of fumarate to malate.
4.2.1.2

G6PD
pentose phosphate
catalyzes the chemical reaction: D-glucose 6-phosphate + NADP+ + H2O ⇌ 6-phospho-D-glucono-1,5-lactone + NADPH + H+

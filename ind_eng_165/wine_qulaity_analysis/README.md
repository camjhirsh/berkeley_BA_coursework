# Which quantitative features of wine lead to high subjective rankings?

Using the data from this study:

Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos, and J. Reis, “Modeling wine preferences by data miningfrom physicochemical properties”,Decision Support Systems, vol. 47, no. 4:547-553, 2009.

I will generate coefficients for a linear model (comparing OLS, Ridge, and Lasso) relating a subjective wine quality score to different quantitative features of wine to see if there are a set of features that are more responsible for good/bad wine taste rankings.
